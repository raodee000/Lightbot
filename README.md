### Lightbot
# After playing both versions of Lightbot, I have to say it's a little bit addicting. The problem solving makes it really fun and a good learning expirience. At first the levels were easy and didn't need for functions but after you actually had to plan out the steps and do a lot of trial and errors. The programming style was hard for me since the last time I actually did progaming was 2 years ago so it was a little hard to remeber the basics but soon it became easy to use. Light bot was a very fun game and I would want to continue playing. Lightbot can help everyone understand the process of making robots and programming them. As I said before, I needed to do some levels like 20 times before undrstanding the pateern and passing it. So this makes me think in real life too, I would probably take 50 trials and errors before I actually get a successful product.
